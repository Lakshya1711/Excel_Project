ðŸš€ Project Showcase: Store Data Analysis with Excel ðŸš€

I recently completed a comprehensive data project where I tackled data cleaning, processing, visualization, and analysis for a retail store dataset. ðŸ“Š Hereâ€™s an overview of what I achieved:

ðŸ”¹ Data Cleaning: Removed inconsistencies, corrected errors, and standardized entries for accuracy.
ðŸ”¹ Data Processing: Organized and structured the dataset, making it efficient and analysis-ready.
ðŸ”¹ Data Visualization: Created insightful visualizations (charts, graphs) to highlight key metrics and trends.
ðŸ”¹ Data Analysis: Conducted an in-depth analysis to uncover sales trends, customer preferences, and product performance.

This project enhanced my Excel skills in advanced functions, pivot tables, charts, and analytical thinking, demonstrating Excelâ€™s power in real-world problem-solving! ðŸŒŸ
